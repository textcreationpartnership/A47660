            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Four Humours hath Dominion over the Sick Perſon.</head>
                  <p>TAke of Soder one pound, of the fineſt Tin half a pound, three
ounces of Mercury, melt them; then take the Amalgama all together, and put it
into an Alembick, and you will have about four ounces of Water, which you
ſhall make uſe of as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Pour one or two drops of this Water into the Urine of a ſick

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55120:23"/>and that whereof you ſee to be moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, 'tis
that which prevails in the Body, and will often change, according as it offends
or prejudices Health. The Amalgama is thus proved: Put it into your hand, and
pour thereon two or three drops of Juice of Citron, and it will inſtantly
become red.</p>

a bed of Pumice-ſtone in an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55120:23"/>pot, then a bed of

lute the Pot well, and put it in a Glaſs or Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Fornace for two dayes;
take it out, and pour Vinegar upon the Powders, ſo often till they have
loſt their redneſs; then evaporate the Vinegar in a Glaſs or
Earthen-veſſel well glaz'd, in which will remain the tincture or colour of
Coral. So you may draw all ſorts of Colours of Minerals and Metals reduc'd to
powder. The Doſe is one dram in an Egg.</p>

                  <p>Take Virgin-wax and ſcrape it into a new Pot, wherein you have
put little pieces of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſo that the Coral be therewith covered, melt and
boyl them gently upon live coals, and the Wax will draw all the Tincture of
Coral: the which you ſhall try by taking out a little piece of the Coral,
which you muſt do commonly within a Quarter of an hour. <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55120:24"/>Withdraw the Fire, and let the Wax cool; which you ſhall take and
ſcrape into an Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and pour thereon good thrice diſtill'd Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, or
ſtrong Spirit of Wine, and put it on hot Embers, that the Wax may give to the
Vinegar the tincture which it took from the Coral; then take it from the Fire,
and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, ſeparate the Vinegar from the Wax, and evaporate it; being

that flows, in the morning, three hours after Dinner, and at night going to

Board upon the Clay, on the inſide the Counter-Mould, the ſharp Edge to the
ſide of the perſon you are to mould; but if you place theſe Boards from
the Soles of the Feet to the calf Gartering place, knees, or higher, do it
according as the Leg, Thigh, or other part of the Body is ſcituated more or
leſs inward or outward; the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure being caſt, and theſe pieces taken
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, you have the place where to open the Mould. Having raiſed your
Counter-Mould as high as the Shoulders, make a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Trough about two or
three foot long, which muſt reſt on the top of your Mould, one end joyning
to the Neck of your Figure, at the other end place a wooden Tunnel as big as a
large Pail, then take ſix or ſeven large Staves or Ribs of a large Cask or
Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, bind them faſt about it with a Cord, for fear it ſhould burſt,
then take Plaiſter well burnt, and daſh it into a large Tub of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or
into ſeveral large Braſs Pails or Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, with which (being neither too
thick nor too thin) fill your Counter-Mould through the Tunnel, that it may run
down the Trough, pour it as faſt as you can, to that purpoſe, have
ſeveral hands to aſſiſt, being fill'd, the Plaiſter will be ſet in
a little time, which done, pull down the Counter-Mould, then with a large Knife
or ſuch like Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, dreſs the outſide of your Mould while 
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55120:161"/>the Plaiſter continues eaſie to cut, then take out
the thin pieces of Wood, and have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pieces of about a foot and half long,
more or leſs, in form of a Wedge, and ſharp as a Knife, about a Finger
thick on the back, and about half a foot broad, place theſe in the Clefts
made by the ſmall Boards, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your Mould, which muſt be done with as
few pieces as you can; thus have you an upright Figure in two pieces, except
the Arms. But in Figures lying all along, the Mould muſt be in more pieces;
but if the Figure have one or both Arms extended, draw a Circle like a
Bracelet, with red Ink round about the Arm or Arms about half a foot from the
Shoulder, which Mark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imprinted in the Mould, the Figure ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, will
alſo have the ſame, which will eaſily direct where to cut it, and to fit
the length of the Arm to the Body of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; if you deſire a Copy of the
Figure, dreſs the Mould, tye the pieces ſtrongly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and caſt
Plaiſter into it. But if you would caſt a Figure of Bronze or Braſs,
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Mould where you put the ſmall pieces of Wood, or elſe with
an Iron Wier, ſaw your Mould as near to the Hollow as poſſible you can,
ſo that putting a bigger Wedge into the Cleft, you may open your Mould, being
divided ſo as that you may caſt your Wax Figure, make thick pieces of
Earth, according to the precedent Chapter, <pb n="280" facs="tcp:55120:162"/>dry it,
greaſe it, and make a Kernel or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Mould, put in the Iron Points or
Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to ſupport it, take out your thickneſs of Earth, pour in the Wax,
then melt it out, and bake the Mould as before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>In like manner you may take off all ſorts of Figures and
Poſtures according to the Life, be ſure to caſt all your Plaiſter at
the ſame inſtant, for many and ſlow Runnings make faulty Moulds; alſo
the perſon being up to the Neck in Plaiſter, the coldneſs of the Water
will ſo oppreſs his Stomach, that he'l be apt to ſhrink or lift up his
Shoulders, and ſo deform the Mould, to prevent which, let the Water be
lukewarm; if you mix a third of fine Brick with Plaiſter, and ſome
<hi>Plume Alum,</hi> you may caſt Braſs in it, only making a thickneſs of
Earth for to make the Kernel; but before you bake it, give a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or two of
<hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> Water in all the hollow places of the Mould, tying it
with ſtrong Iron Wier or Hoops, and putting in the Broches. Thus may you
caſt very fine Figures alſo in Lead or Tin, the chief thing is to find out
well ſhap'd perſons, and hard Labourers, who have always their Muſcles
more ſtrong and better ſhap'd, than ſuch as live a finer Life, who often
have their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies forc'd to their Cloaths, nor thoſe whoſe Toes grow over
one another, ſet the Perſon right, that the Poſture ſeems not aukward,

compaſs the Face about to hinder the Plaiſter from falling into the Neck,
or upon the Hair, your Plaiſter being good, well temper'd, neither too thick
nor too thin, that you may ſoon have done; let there be two to lay on the
Plaiſter with their hands, beginning at the Forehead, and ſo all along the

Mould with as much thickneſs as 'twill bear, not ſtopping the Noſe, if
the Plaiſter be good, 'twill ſet preſently, then take it gently off, and
you have the Mould of the Face to the Life.</p>
                  <p>Now to remedy the defect under the Noſe, 'tis but clapping a
Chiſſel or repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tool to it, and pouring on a little Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,

with a Bruſh, cover it all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; if it be a living Face, cover the Hair of
the Eye-lids and Eye-brows with Paſte, as alſo the Beard, then with a
Bruſh nimbly cover the Face about the thickneſs of a Half-crown, being
careful not to ſtop the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, and that the Perſon ſqueeze not his
Eyes together, which will render the Face deformed; thus having your Face of
Wax, take it gently off, then ſtrengthen it with Clay on the backſide, that
in pouring in the Plaiſter it may not give way. Thus may you caſt all
ſorts of Faces, Laughing, Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Grimaces or Wry Faces, alſo Feet,

this Compoſition with water upon a Marble, put it into a Shell, and keep this
Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to fill up the Engravings or Cuttings which you have made with
your Gonges; when you have left it two or three hours to dry, polliſh it with
your hand and it will look like Silver. By adding more Quick-Silver, you make a
thinner Compoſition, which with your Thumb you may rub into the Work you have
cut till it be as bright as Silver; inſtead of Tin you may mix Leaf-Silver
